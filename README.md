# SolidWorks Nut and Bolt Mechanical Assembly

![Image of the final assembly](Renders/Nut_Bolt_Assembly_Render.png)

## Project Overview

This project showcases the modeling and mechanical simulation of a standard Nut and Bolt assembly in SolidWorks. The focus is on creating a realistic representation of the threading action by linking rotational and translational motion using a Screw Mate.

## Mechanical Motion Animation

The following animation shows the nut rotating and advancing along the bolt's threads, demonstrating a realistic mechanical motion.

## Key Features

- **Part Modeling:** High-fidelity models of a hexagonal nut and bolt created from scratch.
- **Advanced Mating:** A **Screw Mate** was used to accurately define the relationship between the nut's rotation and its linear travel.
- **Motion Analysis:** A motion study was conducted using a rotary motor to drive the nut, and the resulting motion was calculated and rendered.
